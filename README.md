Small Shell Program - Portfolio Project for Operating Systems I

This my portfolio project for Operating Systems I.

The goal of this project was to create a shell in C, which implented a command line interface with the following features, similar to Bash.

1. Prints an interactive input prompt.
2. Parses command line input into semantic tokens.
3. Implement the following parameter expansion features.
   
    a. $$ - Will be replaced with the process ID of the shell process.
   
    b. $? - Will be replaced with the exit status of the last foreground command.
   
    c. $! - Will be replaced with the process id of the most recent background process.
   
    d. ${parameter} - Generic parameters.
5. Can execute the "cd" and "exit" commands.
6. Can use the following as redirection operators. '<', '>', and '>>'.
7. Custom responses to signals.
